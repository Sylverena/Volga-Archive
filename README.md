# An archive of the Volga site for educational purposes

Volga is a imaginary website for an imaginary bookstore. Created in accordance with an assignment for a class project and as an exploration of PHP and the ~AMP stack, Volga implements several common features found in many websites today, such as a ability to sort and search for books, account creation (including the ability to leave reviews), and a cart that persists in the user's session.

Volga was created for a class project in Server Web Programming (CSCI 322) in spring 2023. It demonstrated my knowledge and proficiency of the course material, namely programming in a full stack environment and securing against common attacks including SQL injection and XSS. Since this project was created in the past, it does not objectively represent my skill in development nor design, as time has past and I have learned much more since then. However, I believe that it does show what I have learned in the past and how I can apply what I have learned in the future
